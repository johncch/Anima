# Anima
A tiny CSS library for animating DOM elements using CSS transitions.                               

## Installation
    <script src="anima.js" type="text/css"></script>
    
## Features
Anima was created with 2 things in mind:
1. Support for sequential animations
2. Support for concurrent animations using the concept of a Frame.

For examples, look at the test page located under test/ 

                                                                                                                                                          
## Warning
This version can only be considered alpha. There are a few areas that                                                                         
1. Implement a non CSS fallback. CSS changes will be executed immediately.                                                      
2. Debug for Opera
3. Test on IE browsers
4. Document
